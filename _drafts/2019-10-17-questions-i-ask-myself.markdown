I ask myself introspective questions everyday to keep me accountable and on track to achieve what I plan to achieve. I intend to update this list every time I change it. I do end up writing the answers down, as described in XXX. 

Here are the questions I ask myself: 

## Every day
1. What did I do today? Was it associated with a longer term goal? 
1. What do I intend to do tomorrow? 
1. Did I learn something new today? Am I grateful about something that happened? 

## Every week
1. What did I do this week? (work and personal tasks are noted separately)
  * Focus is on summarizing how time was spent, internalize trends.
   1. Was I efficient? Was I deliberate?  
1. Are there any priorities that I couldn't get to? Any chores? Why?  
1. What do I intend to do next week?
  * I intend to allocate time based on monthly or yearly goals. This helps me prioritize my week. 

## Every month
1. What did I achieve at work this month?
   1. What was achieved this month? How valuable was it? How happy am I about it?
   1. How much time was spent on what tasks? Were they necessary? Was I efficient? 
   1. What did I learn at work?
   1. What is no longer necessary or valuable? Can something be deprioritized?
1. What did I do with my personal time?
   1. What did I finish what I intended to finish? What did I not?
   1. What is no longer necessary or valuable? Can something be deprioritized? 
  1. How intentional was I with time spent? 
     * It's okay to watch TV as long as I'm intentional about it. It's not okay to wonder where 4 weekends went by when you intended to do something you never got it. 
1. Did I learn anything? 
  * I find it helpful to take note of things, at least mentally. 
1. Did I spend time to achieve my goals for the year?
1. What will I do next weekend? (Personal time and at work)
   1. Prioritize tasks.
   
## Every year
1. Top achievements that I'm proud of?
1. Top mistakes I made?
1. What are the things I learned? 
1. What am I greatful for for this year?
1.
