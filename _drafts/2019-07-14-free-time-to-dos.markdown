This isn't exactly novel. There are a hundred well known and popular to-do apps out there from generalized "lists and notes" taking app to highly specialized ones with reminders and collaboration and subtasks. 

I was already using a list in some form since years, but what I wanted to do was to also capture a lower priority list of things to do when I'm sitting idle. I find myself in situations where I can't spend time on a main goal (commuting to work, those 15 wasted minutes between meetings), or have exhausted myself working on it. To make maximal utilization of my time, I essentially wanted to know what I can do in those short periods of time, which is very different in nature than primary tasks.  

# My Current System

## Google Keep

I really wanted a "dashboard" like view of **all** my tasks. Google Keep is my current solution. It's synced, multi-platform, which are the basic requirements for considering any app. They have colors and labels, 2 dimensions of categorizations which is useful, besides obviously the title of the "sticky". The succientness of each sticky is something I really like. I'm forced to describe tasks in very few words, so I don't end up over-engineering. I can also easily move tasks around, helping easy prioritization by order. 

For tracking tasks, I'm using the current titles:
* Short: small tasks which can be completed in pockets of free time, with no deadlines or urgency. 
* Long: task that'll take long time, or needs to be completed in stages, no deadline or urgency
* To Google: I'm very curious about things I hear that I don't know, so I quickly write them down in this note. Basically anything I need to google. 
* To Think: These are ideas, suggestions, items I need to spend time to think or reflect about. This is a recent addition, but I find it very useful. More on this later. 
* Urgent: Tasks that *need* attention, short or long. Ideally, this sticky should be empty. When it's not, these are the tasks that should be taken up. I like to put things with deadlines on the calendar directly, so these are mostly with a lose deadline.

I have the Urgent sticky shaded in red and on top of my Keep. I use this exact scheme for "Personal" and "Work" tags.
