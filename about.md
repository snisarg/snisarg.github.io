![me]({{ site.url }}/assets/me.jpg)

I'm interested in AI, distributed systems, startups, personal productivity, finance and ideas to help change the world to make it a better place. 

I'm a software engineering in the language and text translation team inside Facebook AI. I primarily work on [PyText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext) 

I've created this blog to mainly have version controlled notes for myself. I do spend a lot of time researching and maybe it helps someone out there in the interweb. :) 

Thoughts and opinions are my own.
