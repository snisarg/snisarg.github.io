I'm interested in AI, distributed systems, startups, personal productivity, finance and ideas to help change the world to make it a better place. 

I'm a software engineering working on proliferation of Deep Learning at Uber AI. 

Previously, I worked at Facebook AI, focusing on frameworks and infrastructure around NLP and ML training in general in the PyTorch org. An Open Source example of some of the work is [PyText.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext) 

I've created this blog to mainly have version controlled notes for myself. I do spend a lot of time researching and maybe it helps someone out there in the interweb. :) 

Thoughts and opinions are my own.
