I was already using lists in some form since years, but I wanted to capture a lower priority list of things to do when I'm sitting idle. I find myself in situations where I can't spend time on anything important (commuting to work, those 15 wasted minutes between meetings), or have exhausted myself working on those. To make maximal utilization of my time, I essentially wanted to know what I can do in those short periods of time, which is very different in nature than primary tasks.

This isn't exactly novel. There are a hundred well known and popular to-do apps out there from generalized "lists and notes" taking app to highly specialized ones with reminders and collaboration and subtasks. 

# My Current System

## Google Keep

I want a "dashboard" view of **all** my tasks. Google Keep is my current solution. It has colors and labels; 2 dimensions of categorizations which is useful. The succientness of each sticky is something I really like. I'm forced to describe tasks in very few words, so I don't end up over-engineering. I can also easily move tasks around, helping easy prioritization by order. 

For tracking tasks, I'm using the current titles:
* Short: small tasks which can be completed in pockets of free time, with no deadlines or urgency. 
* Long: task that'll take long time, or needs to be completed in stages, no deadline or urgency
* To Google: I'm very curious about things I hear that I don't know, so I quickly write them down in this note. Basically anything I need to google. 
* To Think: These are ideas, suggestions, items I need to spend time to think or reflect about. This is a recent addition, but I find it very useful. More on this later. 
* Urgent: Tasks that *need* attention, short or long. Ideally, this sticky should be empty. When it's not, these are the tasks that should be taken up. I like to put things with deadlines on the calendar directly, so these are mostly with a lose deadline.

I have the Urgent sticky shaded in red and on top of my Keep. I use this exact scheme for "Personal" and "Work" tags, separating those concerns. 

# Other Apps

## Google Docs 

From [my previous post, Project Acountability]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-06-project-accountability %}), I sometimes "forward" log items that I need to complete on a given day. I essentially create a plan for the next day on it.

## OneNote

For really detailed tasks that generally need links or detailed break-downs, I have the details down on a REAL note taking app like OneNote. I still use Keep to remind me of this task, but write the details I need when I am working on said task so I can continue where I left it in case time runs out.
