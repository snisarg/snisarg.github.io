*Where to keep emergency funds in a higher rate environment: Savings Acc v CDs v Treasury Bills v Money Market Funds*

Note that the rates highlighed below are valid for 10th Dec, 2023.

## Safest “can't lose principle” options

| Type | Interest Rates (APY %) | Post tax effective rates @ 40% Fed, 10% state (APY %) | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Savings Account | 4.35 | 2.18 |  |
| CDs for 1 year | 5.2 | 2.6 |  |
| T-Bills  | 5.2 | 3.12 | No state tax |
| Federal Money Market funds (Used FDRXX) | 5 | 3 |  |
| CA Money Market funds (used FABXX) |  | 2.5 | No Fed or CA state tax |

For this date and interest rates, it seems that T-Bills provide the highest yield post tax. 

## Funds with risk based on interest rates

| Type | Interest Rates (APY %) | Post tax effective rates @ 40% Fed, 10% state (APY %) | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLT (20+ year treasury ETF)  | 4.35 | 2.61 | No state tax  |
| SHV (<1 year treasury ETF) | 5.17 | 3.1 | No state tax  |
| CMF (CA Muni Fund) |  | 3.17 | No Fed or CA state tax |
| CALY (CA short term) |  | 3.08 | No Fed or CA state tax |
