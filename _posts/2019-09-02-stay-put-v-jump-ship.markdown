Although this is coming from my experience of changing jobs as a software engineer, I'll try to be generic. I believe engineers great flexibility in choosing employers or working on their own projects. Here are some of the things I consider before finding a new employer. 

# When To Change Jobs

One or more of these are good reasons for jumping ship:

* Dissatisfaction

  If you absolutely do not like your job, think you're stuck or have a bad working environment (that you've failed to fix).

* Personal Growth

  If you are not learning new skills or if you want to try something new, like a new interest or passion and know that you will be able to figure out finances (because if the change means you'll start fresh, and will probably paid less too).
  
* Monetary reasons

  You are paid less than current market rates.
  
* Change of environment 

  You want to change the environment: startup v. big corporation, different city/country, new challenges.
  
* Healthy job market
  
    The best time to change jobs is when everyone seems to be hiring in your area of expertise. It's nice to be able to apply to multiple places and pick what works best for you. The salaries are also generally higher in a competitive market. 

# When To Stay Put

You will have to sacrifice these if you switch jobs:

* Time 

  There's a significant time investment associated with finding new opportunities: These depend on your occupation, but general steps to it which take time are:
  1. Prepare for interviews
  1. Look for companies that are hiring 
  1. Interview 
  1. Comparing offers, make a decision
  1. Quit and move
  1. At the new place, understand new processes, frameworks and workflows before you can get productive 
  
  You want to make sure that there's at least a fair chance that this time investment will be worth it; whether it's better pay, able to work at a better place, or the satisfaction from the new role.
  
* Context

    Longer tenured employees perform significantly better, navigate through problems faster and are more resourceful because they have a significant context built through the time spent at a given place. The reasons for this are:
    
    * Network

      They can get help faster because the know more people, know who's doing what and can cut through the hierarchies or "internal document searches" which are never really up-to-date.
      
    * History
    
      Older employees have seen systems and processes evolve. They know why a service was built *that* way and how the hiring process evolved. So when it comes to revamping the hiring process again, they'll know exactly what has worked before and what hasn't, leading to better and faster decision making. 
    
    * Clout
    
        There's a good chance the Director knows about the older employee already. Newer projects will fall in their laps and higher level decisions will include them, even if there's a newer, more experienced hire. People will also go to them for help first, leading to more learning and increased clout. 
        
* Growth/Promotions

  Because of reasons mentioned above, longer tenured employees have an advantage of faster promotions: they can get things down faster and take on crucial challenges that could be unknown to newer employees. On the flip side, joining a new firm means you'll have to learn new intricasies of the job and demonstrate skills before being considered for a promotion.
    
* Known unknowns and unknown unknowns
    
  These are the risks associated with the change. Maybe you don't like *New City* after all or *New Company* is actually not a great place to work. These can be minimized by converting unknown unknowns to known unknows by research and talking to people. 

# Thought Process for Making a Decision

Ask yourself the following questions in this order:

1. Is the dissatisfaction temporary?

    You don't want to make knee-jerk decisions!

1. Is the unhappiness truly related to work? 
    
    Maybe all you need to do is fix the relationship with your manager or take an overdue vacation.

1. Did you talk to your boss about it? Maybe you haven't clearly communicated what you would and would not like to do? 
    
    If you really want to work on another project, or want a raise, asking should be light-weight. I've heard a lot of instances where the manager was completely unaware and could have made accomodations.

1. Do you want to consider other opportunities within your company? 

    Hiring good talent hard, time consuming, risky and expensive. Most company should be happy to let you transfer to a new team or department instead of seeing you go. 
  
  1. You are not falling for "grass is greener on the other side"? 
  
      It's easy to hear good things about other work places, but what if the problems you're considering leaving for also exists at companies you may consider to interview for? Talking to others will help.
      
1. Have you weighted your pros and cons? 

    The points from section <a href="#when-to-change-jobs">When To Change Jobs</A> should help.
    
1. Is the job market in good shape for you to get an ideal role/company/position right now?

    You don't want to spend the efforts looking for a new job when not a lot of places are hiring. This will limit options.

1. Is it worth it to pay the significant cost of time for the change? Are you willing to put in the efforts? 

If the answer to all the above questions are yes, then you should strongly consider looking for a change. All the best for your job hunt! 

# Short Circuiting

1. A way to short-circuit the decision making process is to see if you're going to regret not changing jobs later in life aka [Jeff Bezos' Regret Minimization Framework](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/jeff-bezos-this-is-how-to-avoid-regret.html). It's always nice to experiment, and the cost may be worth it rather than regrets later in life. Remember, this is a reversible decision. If you quit on good terms (as you should), you can always choose to go back.

1. You can talk to others about their job satisfaction and work to compare notes so you can make informed decisions. 

1. If money or role is a concern, it's easier to interview at other places to see what they have to offer. This has the added advantages of learning what options are other there, what are the current trends in your industry and how other companies are doing; as you talk with people who are hiring. This also helps you keep your interview skills up. Coding interviews need practice!
