This note talks about tax advantaged schemes in the US I employee and my current thinking into why and how much I should be investing with these accounts. 

## HSA

*Not taxed going in, not taxed pulling money out; restrictions apply.*

If you have a high deductible insurance plan, you can use the Health Savings Account as an investment vehicle. 

It has a limit of $3,550 a year, but you don't have to pay tax for the amount nor pay tax withdrawing from this account, as long as the withdrawals are for medical purposes. Look for HSA compliant purchases for a comprehensive list.

To take the maximum advantage of this account, save your medical receipts and reimburse them all in one go when you really need the money, hopefully much later in life. Till then, let the money grow in this account tax free. 

The biggest disadvantage of this account is that you need to keep track of your medical receipts yourself. A teammate from my old job literally maintained a shoe-box to put these in. Some HSA accounts now let you upload receipts for safe-keeping too and you can apply these expenses as and when you need the money. This is great as it takes most of the overhead out.

## Backdoor ROTH IRA

*Taxed going in, no tax going out;*

Traditional IRA accounts are used to invest for retirement with pretax money. Unfortunately, this has an income limitation of $124,000 for investing. This can be overcome by a well known loophole in the tax code, hence the name "Backdoor" ROTH IRA.

The idea is to put money you've already paid tax on in the Traditional IRA and move that into a ROTH IRA after a few days. You can do that for up to $6000 a year, which is the limit for 2020. Make sure you move the money quickly, as you will owe taxes on any gains while it's in the Traditional IRA account.

## Employee sponsored plans

### 401k

*No tax going in, tax pulling money out; Employer may match a portion of contributions*

A popular scheme if provided by the employer to reduce one's taxable income. Many companies also match your contribution by a percentage and up to a certain percentage of your salary. This is basically free money into your 401k account on top of whatever you've elected to save. 

The limit for 2020 on 401k contribution is $19,500. See Restrictions section for more details. 

### Mega-backdoor ROTH

*Taxed going in, no tax going out; Should be supported by employer*

This employs another tax code loophole, uses 'after-tax' 401k investments and converts them to a 401k ROTH plan. Even though it's a backdoor, it has been codified into the law, so much so that Fidelity even offers automatic conversion from the after-tax account to ROTH (called daily in-plan conversion)

The biggest downside of this is that it is employer dependent, so you may or may not be able to do this.

### Restriction

401k contributions are limited, but there are no specific limits on employer's contribution or after-tax contributions. Instead, there's a maximum total limit of $57,000 on the sum total of these three. 

## My thoughts

I'm thankful that I have a job in tech and get paid a very competitive salary. My intuition going forward is that since the salaries will potentially remain competitive, I can take home very little right now but maximize my retirement investments as far as possible. I would have invested my salary anyway, so might as well get a favorable tax treatment by investing via the accounts mentioned above. A hidden advantage is that because of these, my take home salary is much smaller, which keeps my spending in check. 

You want to start as early as possible as each of these accounts have a yearly maximum allowed. 

I love the ROTH accounts because I can invest in safe investments which don't get special tax treatments like the long term capital gains tax.

### HSA

By getting an account with someone that lets you upload receipts for future reimbursement, the pain to manage an HSA account is almost out. My current employer does not support it, but paying no tax on investments is great.

### Backdoor ROTH IRA

I've started investing with this account ever since I got to know about it. I am risking not being able to withdraw the principle amount for 5 years, but in return I save tax on investments that I would have made anyway with that money. 

### 401k

I am currently investing to get my employer's match so I don't leave any free money on the table. I am considering investing more in the future if I can build up enough savings. 

### Mega-backdoor ROTH

I am maximizing the $27,500 I can invest via this vehicle. This limit is set by my current employer to keep 401k investments under $57,000 at all times. My reasoning for using this strategy include:

- Not all employers offer this, so I want to maximize the benefit while I work at a place that does.
- The strategy again is that I would have potentially invested this amount anyway, might as well do it by saving tax. I do lose the opportunity to withdraw this money.
