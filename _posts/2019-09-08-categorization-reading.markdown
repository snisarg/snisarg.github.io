I want to unify categories of articles and books I read and notes I take. I like to revist them frequently, and categorization will go a long way in making things eaiser. I couldn't find any standard followed for books, or a popular technique that is more nuanced. 

Note that these are categories based on the books I read, and I don't intend to generalize these any time soon. 

1. AI

    Because I separate this from Computer Science, which goes in "code". It's really a separate and a bigger thing. 

1. Code
    
    Anything to do with CS. I break these down into topics in my notes, like Distributed Systems and Design Patterns too.

1. Entrepreneurship
    
    Stories, ideas, principles and how-tos; all can go here.

1. Etiquettes
   
   Couldn't think of a better name for a catch all for things like better presentation skills, social skills, etc

1. Health
  
    Healthy eating, gym routines

1. Industry
    
    I didn't want to mix dialog about various industries (which end up being mostly tech for me) and code, which is very specific to CS. This is about where the industry is going, it's impact on the world, etc. 

1. Language
    
    Writing well, reading well, learning other languages (For me it's mainly Japanese)

1. Legacy 
   
   I love reading about people or companies and how they evolved over time or achieve what they did. Autobiographies, in a way. 

1. Mind
    
    Memory improvement, happiness, intelligence, thought processes, motivation; anything to do with how to think or learn better.

1. Money
  
    Investing, financial advice, stock market, planning, theories, predictions. 

1. Productivity
    
    Tooling, ideas, things that are directly related to productivity but don't fall in the "mind" category. (I may want to club those two together. Need to think about this.)

1. Research

    Any other interests, like Math go here. They're usually research-y topics.
